# Project Todos ‚úîÔ∏è

This week projects assigntment was to build a Todo app by using redux-toolkit. We learned how to reate new slices, create new reducers, create new actions and what immutability means and how to work with it.
 
 ## How did I do it?
I started the project by googling around on how different Todo applications work and look like. I use a app myself called Any.do and foud the functions in it inspirational. And becuase of taking care of sick kids all week I gave my app a little design touch inspired by a song that has been looping a lot - do do do do... ü¶à ‚ú®

What I learned:
* This week it was a lot of different parts to learn regarding all new functions so I began to divide everything in small pieces. I started selecting data from the store, using useSelector and dispatching data to the store depending on the action the user is doing using useDispatch.

* I then started by building upp App.js, the reducer and my start components (AddTodo and ToDoList) that I needed to make the app work. Later on I added a few more components (Header, Checkbutton, NoMoreTodos and ClearAllTodos). 

* I also decided to use styled components for the first time and found it very fun and flexible to work with.

* Implemented using local storage in the browser so whatever the initial state is it'll be retrieved from there rather than the global store. What it does is that it enables the user to still see todo's added when the page is reloaded.

Interesting thread about the usage of it on StackOverflow:
